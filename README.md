# sensor_software
This repository contains a number of software applications related to both the operation and data processing for a number of sensor packages.

Both C++ (Arduino) and Python (RPi) code are used.

Current device support includes:
  * Local HRR sensor (NDIR + TC temp + DPT flow)
  * Inverse Heat Flux Device (TC temp + DPT flow)
